## Development Experience
- Technologies I know
   - Languages: SQL, C#, Linq, XML, JSON, Java, HTML, CSS, Java Script
	- Frameworks & Methodologies: .NET, MVVM, WPF, Entity Framework, Scrum, Agile, TDD, NPM, 
	- Software & Dev Tools: Visual Studio, SSMS, APIâ€™s, Git, GitHub, Nuget Packages, DevExpress, RedGate, JIRA, Octopus, Team City, Artifactory, Moq, Slack, TFS, cmder, Nlog, Microsoft Office Suite
	- Operating Systems: Windows, Macintosh
- Stole the above right off my resume but here are some things I like
	- C# is similar to Java what I learned in college, so it being familiar when I started was very helpful.  I have learned to love it, but it is what I have done the majority of my career. 
	- SQL all our data is in SSMS so I am very proficient in SQL.  At my current employer we have a lot of Stored Procedures, and they are trying to get away from this and use more Entity Framework which is great for testing but yet you can do some powerful things in SQL, that I can write in a few min. that are not as easy to translate to EF.
	- RedGate is awesome it is an extension for SSMS that makes all my SQL work a breeze, auto completes table joins, and has several sweet short cuts for common task, such as copy as in clause, scripting out table creates and many others.
	- At the same time I really enjoy Linq and EF, because we don't have to make a procedure for every bit of data we may need.
	- I  like .Net for all the documentation and support that exists vs. Java Script
	- Octopus and Team City are new to me but have been amazing to use, with our teams huge Go Live where we deployed 11 apps all at once having the quick ability to fix a bug and approve the PR then get it into Prod by simply pushing a button was amazing.
## Git Commands
- At my current position I rarely ever use Git Commands I use the GitHub Extension in Visual Studio but I can command line no problem. 
	- Functions I frequently used with the GitHub Extension: Push, Fetch, Pull, Merge, Commit, Clone, Branches
	- Commands uses via command line the most
		- git commit -m "message" - Just the standard way to commit changes
		- git status - see what changed
## Continuing Education
- How I learn
	- My current position I have not had hardly any time to do continuing education other than what is needed in the moment, due to constant strict deadlines without enough help to carry the load.  As well as being a father of 2 young kiddos.
	- I have used Pluralsight and Linda.com videos and test projects to learn, obviously Stackover flow to help when I get stuck
	- I also learn very well by doing, so just trying out test projects to see what all I can do with the new technology
- Interesting Projects I am currently working on: 
	- We recently just had our biggest Go Live for our team, where we deployed 11 different applications all at once, 7 of which were all brand new.
	- There's one service and one API that communicates to all the other background processes that create all the work for 2 different Distribution Centers that operate 24-7
	- The process takes orders, turns them into invoices, reduces Inventory, processes data from the warehouse, then bills all product on the back end
	- Learning the API and finally having an app that updates data for all users signed in where everyone can see what is happening when orders are begin processed was really awesome
