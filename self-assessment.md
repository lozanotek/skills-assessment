<H1>Development Experience</H1>
.NET Development experience: I learned ASP.NET in about 2008 while at Nationwide Bank.  We converted a classic ASP and HTML 
Website to ASP.NET WebForms with C#.  I also worked on a back end Windows Service which retrieved customer login requests from 
the Website and returned the customer data using IBM MQ messages.  I made various other updates to the customer Website and 
our Correspondent Website and a Subservicing Website.  The technology on both the front end and back end were great improvements. 
At DLL Finance, I worked on various Websites.  Their legacy Website updated dealers with loan application information.  
The new Website was www.DLLFinance.com, which was built on a Sitecore Content Management System (CMS) platform.  This was also 
a great improvement from the old.  The Website Become A Dealer form sends updates to Windows services.  I worked on a back end 
VB.NET Windows Service which loaded data from received from the Windows service and into a SQL database. 
Most recently, at Dee Zee, I worked on their existing ERP system which is VB.NET.  A lot of the work was SSRS reports and 
creating or updating SQL Stored Procedures. 
One thing I like about .NET is how Visual Studio has greatly improved and makes the development process much easier and faster
than it was in previous versions.
