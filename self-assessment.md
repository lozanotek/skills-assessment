1. **Development Experience** - What technologies do you know? What do you like about them?

 I am most comfortable with .NET technologies. I developed the front-end and back-end of C# and VB.NET apps using MVC and Webforms
utilizing .NET Framework for a year and a half. I worked on a couple of console apps, but most of my work was fixing bugs and adding new features to 
large applications. I worked on a SOAP API as well. I really enjoyed the .NET world, C# is very nice to work with and is quite robust as a language. 
 
 I've been building Node.js apps at home when I have time. Node.js seems to be a bit more straightforward than .NET. Even though there aren't many big 
differences, there are some things I like about Javascript a lot. For example, the ability to access an object's properties dynamically is easier in
Javascript. 
 
 I've also recently been helping a friend with his Wordpress business. I've built two Wordpress plugins in PHP for him. Even though Wordpress is a nice
and quick way to have a basic, nice website, Wordpress is too opinionated for me. PHP also seems to be a little outdated with its available tooling.

 2. **Git Commands** - What are your favorite git commands? Give a simple description for each.

 I'm relatively new to git. My full-time position used Microsoft's TFS source control.
So far I've used the following on a regular basis:

 git clone - clone a git repository
git status - tells me which tracked files have changed since my last commit
git add - stages changes in prep for commit
git commit - adds file changes to my local branch
git push - pushes changes up to the remote repository

 3. **Continuing Education** - How do you learn new things? What interesting projects are you currently working on?

 I follow blogs of many good industry professionals in different fields. (David Walsh, Troy Hunt, etc.)
 
 When I have an idea for an app, I try to learn a new technology while building it. For example, I'm currently working on an app that actively listens
to a speaker and whenever that speaker references certain material (in this case a Bible verse) the app will retrieve it and display it on the screen.
I'm using Express.js and Pug.js for the first time while building this. I'm also thinking of teaching myself how to use Docker or AWS with this app.

 I'm also going to start going to code meetups here in St. Louis in order to learn as well as network (which alows me to learn in the process!).
