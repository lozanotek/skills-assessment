# Development Experience
Most of my expierence and comfort is in the Microsoft stack.  I am very comfortable writing C# in Web Forms, MVC, or Web API.  I'm less skilled on the front end side of things, but can write vanilla JavaScript as well as Angular; HTML and CSS as well.
* C# is a multi-purpose, object orriented programming language created by Microsoft.  It is used by many companies world wide.
* Web Forms is a web application framework created by Microsoft.  It is older and therefore not as popular, but I'm sure many companies still use it today.
* MVC is allso a web application framework created by Microsoft.  It is still widely used by many developers.  As one would expect, it implements the Model-View-Controller pattern.
* Web API is a framework for building web services, almost always in a RESTful manor.
* JavaScript is a multi-purpose, client-side programming language.  It is one of the most popular programming languages that exists.
* Angular is a JavaScript framework created by Google.  It has quickly gained populairty and is used by many developers.
* HTML and CSS are core, front-end languages.  Every developer uses them, some are better than others and making things pretty with them.

# Git Commands
I've found the stash command to be extremely useful thoughout my career.  It allows you to quickly switch branches and not lose your work if you need to focus on something else, which happens quite often.  Rebasing has also become very useful for us as we've started to follow a trunk-based branching strategy.  It helps you keep your branch clean and easy to understand.  Reset is a command I use often as well.  Sometimes you get going down a path and find out it isn't going to work.  Resetting allows you to easily start fresh.

# Continuing Education
Reading is the main way that I learn new things.  Between Hacker News and Twitter, there's no shortage of articles to read on new technology, patterns, and tools.  Many companies also have some pretty good technology/engineering blogs which are interesting to read.  I've been fortunate to have my current employer supply us with Pluralsight subscriptions as well.  Probably my favorite way to learn is by pairing/talking with others.  I love to pair with my team members and usually come away with something new.
