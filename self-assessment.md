## Continuing Education
* I develop non-stop. Unfortunately, I've been doing it all wrong the whole time. Instead of working on projects for myself, getting clients should have been my focus. Not that all is lost. Everything I did was to learn a new technology. I was trying to get Angular 5 experience so I started a new project called EdgeBettor. I've gotten myself into deep waters with this project learning Angular 5, and now Python. I have pushed a Node.JS API using a MySQL database to Heroku. I have another Heroku instance running a Python build pack. I wrote a cron script to call some web scrapers that pull game info which I send to my API.
