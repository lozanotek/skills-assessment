# Skills Assessment for Rusty Davis

The following are the three sections outlined in the instructions:

## Development Experience

* C# - Very comfortable with C# developing anything from Web API, MVC, to command line.

* RESTful API - Comfortable creating API's

* HTML - I'm comfortable designing UI's to optimize the user experience or generate action.

* Bootstrap - Love the ease of using Bootstrap

* AngularJS - Ugh...prefer not to work in this.

* Angular - Love working with this. I'm working on a project for myself that I am using Angular and Bootstrap. Learning a lot!

* JavaScript - I'm comfortable creating a Node.JS API to Angular 5 application. Experience with JQuery, AngularJS, and Angular 5.

* Typescript - I like this for strongly typing the JavaScript. It provides structure and yells at you when something is wrong.

* SQL Server - I'm comfortable designing and reading SQL server databases.

* MySQL - Getting really comfortable with it for WordPress and my current project.

* MongoDB - Experience with it during Udemy.com courses that had MongoDB backends.

* Stored procedures - Is there a better place to hide logic? Just kidding, but a really powerful database tool.

* Git - I use it at work and on my home projects. Nothing too fancy.

* TFS - I've used this version control system professionally on several gigs.

* Android - I've completed an Android course with about 20 different projects in it. Nothing professional or paid.

* WordPress - Like most developers, I didn't give it the time of day. I read an article that got me interested in it. I took some online courses on it and have some locally developed WordPress sites. 

* PHP - Using WordPress, I've become a novice PHP developer.

* Python - I recently setup a web scraper. I Fiverr'ed the scraping but have to maintain them. I then added them to Heroku and setup my own Python clock script with a couple of crons that run the scrapers. I'm also getting into machine learning with TensorFlow. I will also use PyTorch, but TensorFlow first.

* Heroku - I have been hosting for a long time on other sites. I'm putting a site up that I'm not sure what it's usage will be so I want it to be scalable. In the Angular course I'm taking, the instructor demonstrated several cloud hosting options. Heroku was one of them.

* IIS - Fairly comfortable debugging/investigating IIS issues.

* Debugging - Solving problems is so much easier when you know your tools and are able to step through problems. Of course, you can't beat the stand by, logging.

* Machine Learning and TensorFlow - I am so new to this, but I find it so fascinating. I just completed the building of a dataset for MLB money lines and I'm going to try to setup a project to help predict results.

* VB 6 - Oh hell no! Well, what's the rate?

* SEO - Online course to improve SEO. Implementing as I go on my WordPress and EdgeBettor sites.

* Landing Page Optimization - The psychology behind UI/UX is amazing. I'm implementing this in my WordPress and EdgeBettor sites.

* Lead Generation - Getting users to provide their contact information is the biggest hurdle in online sales. With SEO and Land Page Optimization, you can identify conversion rates, testing, and identify what's working and not.

## Git Commands
* git status  - gotta see what's dirty
* git add .	- I like the add all command
* git commit  - commit early and often
* git pull	- fingers crossed there are no conflicts
* git push    - ahh, task complete



## Continuing Education
* I develop non-stop. Unfortunately, I've been doing it all wrong the whole time. Instead of working on projects for myself, getting clients should have been my focus. Not that all is lost. Everything I did was to learn a new technology. I was trying to get Angular 5 experience so I started a new project called EdgeBettor. I've gotten myself into deep waters with this project learning Angular 5, and now Python. I have pushed a Node.JS API using a MySQL database to Heroku. I have another Heroku instance running a Python build pack. I wrote a cron script to call some web scrapers that pull game info which I send to my API.
