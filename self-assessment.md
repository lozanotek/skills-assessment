///   Development Experience:
///         Nodejs: utilize this to build a web environment for our JS applications. 
///             Great documentation and easy to use.
///         Hapijs: Server side language for JS applications, I really like to ability to add Auth Options inside 
///             server routes to lock down API calls!
///         Javascript with React: Componentizing everything makes testing and reusability of code very easy.
///         .Net (ASP, MVC & Core): .Net is diffidently a favorite of mine! I try to follow up on the class 
///             library Core as much as possible, as well as VS 2019 (coming soon!) and Azure services! 
///             I love the idea of leveraging Web Services! 
///         Angular 1: Old and Like the wild west of JS. I like working on one of our applications at work 
///             that has this version. It’s difficult to clean up and re-write tangled code, but also a great 
///             exercise to better understand how bad practices can affect developers into the future! 
///         Concourse, Kubernetes, Docker, Octopus, TeamCity: these are all the services I’ve been able to 
///             leverage and play with for continues integration and continuous deployments! 
///         SQL: Most of my development career has been full stack. Learning best practices of SQL was a must. 
///             I enjoy writing APIs and creating DB structures! Really, creating the entire architecture 
///             together with a team is so fulfilling and fun!  
///         Postman: Very easy to use, and great when trying to figure out how to structure a 
///             SOAP with to see what APIs will return! I’ve run into some weird data responses with XML 
///             and this tool has been wonderful!
///   Git Commands: 
///         git add –p: I love doing patch adds, just ensures I don’t commit unwanted files/code
///         git push: Always use this before I leave work, feels good to merge work up and to not have 
///             anything only on my local directory
///         git reset HEAD@{index} or –hard origin/master: Always great to use whenever 
///             I realize that my last commit wasn’t exactly right! Happens to the best!
///         git stash/git stash pop: Love doing this when trying a quick POC.
///         git commit –am: Nice quick way to add and comment, if it’s a really small change
///         git status: Nice to visually see all files I’ve messed with or added.
///   Continuing Education:
///         I push myself to work with experienced developers within the office and always ask a ton of questions!
///         I love discussion with teammates and others about my current code solution, or ideas.
///         I follow a few news feeds on my phone to help keep myself updated with the .Net and JS communities. 
///         I do some small projects, if time allows, to simply learn and play with new technologies. 
///         For instance, I recently did a small project for web scrapping in Python. 
///         I heard Python was great for it and so I web scraped USA Track and Field’s records 
///             and found out how many were USA athletes . 
///         To be honest, I’m a lifelong learner and an extremely hard worker. 
///         If a new project arises with technologies I’m unfamiliar with, I’m not afraid to say help, 
///             ask questions and can assure you that I will work very hard!
