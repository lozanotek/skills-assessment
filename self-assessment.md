# Development Experience - What technologies do you know? What do you like about them?
* C#
    * I wear rose tinted glasses considering I have been creating solutions with C# for over 15 years now. Being an early adopter and convert from Java/C++ at the time it has been a fun journey and a warm, comfortable blanket at this point in my career.
    * Not that other languages don't have similar, or identical features, but a few of them that stand out for me that were very helpful when they were released and changed the way I constructed code
        * Generics and Iterators
        * Query Expressions
        * Extension Methods
        * Dynamic Binding - Because sometimes runtime errors are more fun than compile time errors
        * Local functions
    * Visual Studio is still my favorite IDE for development
* Javascript
    * Can't call myself a full stack developer without it.
    * If there is a browser I can run it, for the most part.
    * The power of HTML, CSS, and JS is astounding. And for more than just making websites do the Harlemshake for unsuspecting QAs.
    * Easy to use for quickly prototyping applications and user interaction.
    * Frameworks as far as the eye can see. Job security just keeping up with trends in frameworks.  
* C++
    * Started my career in virtual reality and simulation programming. Cut my teeth as a developer in the C++ world.
    * The optimization of C++, especially for game programming, is beyond compare.


# Git Commands - What are your favorite git commands? Give a simple description for each.
* git grep
    * The power of grep in git. Pretty darn cool. Searching through files in IDEs can be tedious and doesn't require any extra installations like using ack.
    * Can handle regex and color coding
    * Can search specific branches and commits
* git rebase --interactive
    * Combine a series of commits to a new base commit
    * Great way to create a linear history and get rid of the chatter of merge commits as the project progresses
    * --interactive allows for some cool tools to clean up and make consistent the project history


# Continuing Education - How do you learn new things? What interesting projects are you currently working on?
* When a specific work need arises I generally will take a look at Pluralsight to see if any related courses are available. 
* Where would I be in my career without Stackoverflow, which at times teaches more about how not to do something which leads to proper ways to do things.
* For fun learning I follow plenty of blogs and other feeds like Hanselman, Coding Horror, David Walsh, and of course The Daily WTF to see if I recognize any of my peers handiwork in the wild.
* Currently working on a Lua, yes Lua, project that models and helps theory craft different character class builds for the video game Path of Exile. 
* Always using my monthly Azure credits for all sorts of fun things from mobile app services to machine learning. Working to understand how to build and execute predictive analytics for my home shopping needs as I try to become a more fresh and natural food eater.
