<H1>Development Experience</H1>
.NET Development experience: I learned ASP.NET in about 2008 while at Nationwide Bank.  We converted a classic ASP and HTML 
Website to ASP.NET WebForms with C#.  I also worked on a back end Windows Service which retrieved customer login requests from 
the Website and returned the customer data using IBM MQ messages.  I made various other updates to the customer Website and 
our Correspondent Website and a Subservicing Website.  The technology on both the front end and back end were great improvements. 
At DLL Finance, I worked on various Websites.  Their legacy Website updated dealers with loan application information.  
The new Website was www.DLLFinance.com, which was built on a Sitecore Content Management System (CMS) platform.  This was also 
a great improvement from the old.  The Website Become A Dealer form sends updates to Windows services.  I worked on a back end 
VB.NET Windows Service which loaded data from received from the Windows service and into a SQL database. 
Most recently, at Dee Zee, I worked on their existing ERP system which is VB.NET.  A lot of the work was SSRS reports and 
creating or updating SQL Stored Procedures. 
One thing I like about .NET is how Visual Studio has greatly improved and makes the development process much easier and faster
than it was in previous versions. 

<H1>Git Commands</H1>
At Dee Zee and DLL Finance, we used DevOps and VSTS for source control.  
DevOps has a great way of comparing your changes in a branch pull request.  Or command git diff [first branch] [second branch]

<H1>Continuing Education</H1>
I learn skills primarily through online tutorials.  I have a personal PluralSight account. I've gone through skills such as 
Java, RESTful APIs, SQL SSIS, ASP.NET and MVC.  I also sometimes find YouTube videos that are very helpful.  
If I need to learn something more immediate or to resolve a problem, I use Web searches from Google, Bing, or Duckduckgo.  
I am also going through a couple books - Pro ASP.NET Core MVC 2 by Adam Freeman and Learn AngularJS in 1 Day by Krishna Rungta.
