# Skills Assessment for Consultants

This repository contains all the instructions for a quick (+/- 60min) assessment of skills. The purpose of the assessment is to serve as a simple baseline to help evaluate the skills a .NET developer should have.

The assessment will be updated as needed to keep up with changes in the .NET ecosystem.

## Instructions
This is an "open note" and "open Google" assessment. In other words, use all the resources you have available to complete the activities to the best of your ability. If you run into any issues or have questions, open an [issue](https://github.com/lozanotek/skills-assessment/issues). If you don't know how to do something or are stuck, just skip it. There's no harm in saying, *I don't know*. Time is too valuable to be stuck.

To get started, please do the following:

* Fork this repository to your GitHub ID
* Switch to the `git-eval` branch, start the first activity
* Each activity has self contained instructions and the next steps
* Have fun!
