# Skills Assessment for Consultants

This repository contains all the instructions for a quick (+/- 60min) assessment of skills. The purpose of the assessment is to serve a simple baseline to help evaluate the skills a .NET developer should have.

The assessment will be updated as needed to keep up with changes in the .NET ecosystem.

## Activity 1 - Git Evaluation

1. Create a new file called `self-assessment.md`
2. For each of the items below, create a header section and write a small description about it.
3. After you add a response for each section below, commit the change for that section.

### Header Sections
* **Development Experience** - What technologies do you know? What do you like about them?
* **Git Commands** - What are your favorite git commands? Give a simple description for each.
* **Continuing Education** - How do you learn new things? What interesting projects are you currently working on?

Once you're done with these tasks, merge back into the `master` branch as a single commit. Go to the `fizz-buzz` branch for instructions on the next activity.
